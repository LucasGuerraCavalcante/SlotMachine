# SlotMachine
At first, this project was a simple and "primitive" game to play using the terminal, but I realize that my repository was too small to call this as a real project. Then I decided to turn it into a web application, so I can practice and improve my skills and also turn this simple game into a larger project that involves more challenges and more stuff to learn.
